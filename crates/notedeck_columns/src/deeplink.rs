//! Columns' route tokens for the chrome-owned global navigation history.
//!
//! The chrome owns one browser-style [`NavStack`](notedeck::NavStack) spanning
//! every app; each entry carries an opaque `Rc<dyn Any>` route token the chrome
//! never inspects (see [`notedeck::ChromeNavEntry`]). [`ColumnsNavToken`] is the
//! concrete token Columns pushes: either its whole multi-column deck, or a single
//! thread/profile deep-linked in from another app.
//!
//! A deep-link is deliberately *not* a deck column: it renders as its own
//! transient global-nav pane via [`App::render_nav`](notedeck::App::render_nav), and drilling
//! deeper inside it pushes another global deep-link rather than growing a private
//! stack. This keeps the deck's per-column in-pane navigation entirely private —
//! only entering Columns and cross-app opens are global-history events.
